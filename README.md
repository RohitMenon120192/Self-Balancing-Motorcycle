# Self-Balancing-Motorcycle

Problem Statement: Achieving autonomous balance in a two-wheeled motorcycle presents a significant challenge due to the continuous need for dynamic adjustments to uphold stability.

Objective: To engineer a two-wheeled autonomous vehicle capable of maintaining equilibrium independently, akin to the operational principle of a Segway.

Implementation: This project deployed an Arduino board coupled with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to ascertain the motorcycle's tilt and acceleration. Utilizing this data, the Arduino executes computations to adjust the motor's speed and positioning to perpetuate balance.

Challenges Faced: The primary challenge was the real-time processing of IMU data to achieve consistent balance adjustments.

Solution: A PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller was integrated to refine the control strategy, enabling precise adjustments in motor responses based on the IMU feedback.

Results: The project culminated in the successful creation of a self-balancing motorcycle, exemplifying the application of control systems and sensor integration to achieve autonomous stability.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the project successfully developed a self-balancing motorcycle by leveraging an Arduino board, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and a PID controller for dynamic balance control. This innovation demonstrates the potential of integrating control systems and sensor technology to achieve autonomous stability in two-wheeled vehicles, setting a foundation for future advancements in autonomous transportation.
